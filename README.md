Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

This visualization dashboard website contains visualizations associated with a previous project (found under WeatherAnalysis, link:https://github.com/hemanic/WeatherAnalysis) . Specifically, contains plots of weather data and an analysis of their correlation to latitude, including temperature, windspeed, cloudiness, and humidity.

There are individual pages for each plot and a navigation bar to move throughout them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. There is also a page containing a comparison of all of the plots, and another page containing the data used to build them.
